# Simple Realtime chat
## Preface
I'm trying to use Pusher for realtime notification. So it has no salient features.
## Programming language
PHP 7, Javascript with ES6 syntax.
## Features
 - Send messages with emoji, images and files (size < 2MB), play sound.
 - Push notification when tab not focus (work with Chrome and browsers based on chromium ??).
## Notes
 - Notification not working with some browsers such as IE, Edge,...
 - Old browsers not support ES6 syntax.
